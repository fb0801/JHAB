<h3>Assignment details:</h3>
Part 1:
Develop a website – you need to develop 4 web pages. First of all, you need to develop a template, together as a team, then each member needs to develop content for one page using this template. The template needs to satisfy the following requirements: 
•	You need to use HTML5 to identify the parts of the page e.g. section, nav, article etc.) and structure it (display the source code, HTML, with annotations)
•	You need to use a separate CSS file to apply styles for the layout (it has to have responsive layout) and presentation (display the CSS code with annotations)
•	You need to explain the above. For example… How did you structure your pages and why? What layout did you apply? What did you use to achieve that layout (tools and techniques)? Demonstrate responsiveness. How did you style your pages?

Part 2:
Write content for the website – a topic will be provided. You need to find out about the topic allocated to your team and…
•	organise it logically into 4 different pages. 
•	each team member will take responsibility for the content of one page, however, you need to collaborate, meaning that you check each other’s writing and agree on the content for the whole site.
